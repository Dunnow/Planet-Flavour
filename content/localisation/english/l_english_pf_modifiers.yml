  pf_pm_floral_world: "Floral World"
  pf_pm_floral_world_desc: "Large swathes of this planet's surface seasonally bloom into lush fields of flowers."
  pf_pm_biocrystals: "Luminating Biocrystals"
  pf_pm_biocrystals_desc: "Certain species of xenobacteria on this world produce naturally occurring deposits of Rare Crystals as a by product of their biology."
  pf_pm_severe_droughts: "Severe Droughts"
  pf_pm_severe_droughts_desc: "This planet suffers periodic acute droughts across large parts of its surface, dramatically affecting local ecosystems."
  pf_pm_overgrown: "Overgrown"
  pf_pm_overgrown_desc: "The flora of this world is particularly aggressive and fast growing. Any exposed surface is rapidly colonized by the environment."
  pf_pm_floating_rocks: "Buoyant Magnetoliths"
  pf_pm_floating_rocks_desc: "This world possesses a number of naturally occurring hyper magnetic ores. In sufficient concentrations, they can achieve buoyancy and be suspended by the planet's magnetic field."
  pf_pm_thick_atmosphere: "Thick Atmosphere"
  pf_pm_thick_atmosphere_desc: "This world is surrounded by a thick and stormy atmosphere. Trace amounts of Exotic Gases are present throughout."
  pf_pm_thin_atmosphere: "Thin Atmosphere"
  pf_pm_thin_atmosphere_desc: "This planet's atmosphere is thin and anemic. Larger life forms struggle to thrive in its harsh conditions."
  pf_pm_irradiated_world: "Heavy Solar Radiation"
  pf_pm_irradiated_world_desc: "This planet receives an unusually large amount of radiation from its parent star. Life on the surface is strongly affected."
  pf_pm_subterranean_cave_systems: "Subterranean Cave Systems"
  pf_pm_subterranean_cave_systems_desc: "This world has an enormous network of underground caves just below the surface."
  pf_pm_dim_world: "Dim World"
  pf_pm_dim_world_desc: "This planet receives relatively little light from its parent star. Its surface is gloomy and dark."
  pf_pm_tidal_surges: "Tidal Surges"
  pf_pm_tidal_surges_desc: "This planet's large moon produces abnormally strong tidal forces. Coastal environments experience particularly extreme waves and surges."
  pf_pm_fungal_world: "Fungal World"
  pf_pm_fungal_world_desc: "This world's ecosystem is unusually dominated by fungal life. Much of the native plant life is marginal and occupies relatively few ecological niches."
