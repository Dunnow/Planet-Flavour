  pf_pm_irradiated_world: "Heavy Solar Radiation"
  pf_pm_irradiated_world_desc: "This planet receives an unusually large amount of radiation from its parent star. Life on the surface is strongly affected."
  pf_pm_subterranean_cave_systems: "Subterranean Cave Systems"
  pf_pm_subterranean_cave_systems_desc: "This world has an enormous network of underground caves just below the surface."
  pf_pm_dim_world: "Dim World"
  pf_pm_dim_world_desc: "This planet receives relatively little light from its parent star. Its surface is gloomy and dark."
  pf_pm_tidal_surges: "Tidal Surges"
  pf_pm_tidal_surges_desc: "This planet's large moon produces abnormally strong tidal forces. Coastal environments experience particularly extreme waves and surges."
  pf_pm_fungal_world: "Fungal World"
  pf_pm_fungal_world_desc: "This world's ecosystem is unusually dominated by fungal life. Much of the native plant life is marginal and occupies relatively few ecological niches."
  pf_pm_extraplanetary_life: "Extraplanetary Life"
  pf_pm_extraplanetary_life_desc: "Life on this world shares a common origin with that of another planet in the system. It is unclear whether its origins are natural or artificial."
  pf_pm_planetary_rings: "Planetary Rings"
  pf_pm_planetary_rings_desc: "This planet is surrounded by a disc of orbiting rock and ice. The ring system provides easy access to minerals and is spectacular to behold."
  pf_pm_megacoral_reefs: "Megacoral Reefs"
  pf_pm_megacoral_reefs_desc: "This planet's oceans are home to enormous coral ecosystems. The seas around these reefs are incredibly productive."
  pf_pm_bioluminescent_flora: "Bioluminescent Flora"
  pf_pm_bioluminescent_flora_desc: "The plant life of this world exhibits a unique form of bioluminescence. It has a calming effect on most sentient beings."
  pf_pm_toxic_spores: "Toxic Spores"
  pf_pm_toxic_spores_desc: "The atmosphere of this world is filled with countless millions of toxic spores. Although harmless to the indigenous lifeforms, it is particularly hazardous for non-native life"
  pf_pm_abundant_parasites: "Abundant Parasites"
  pf_pm_abundant_parasites_desc: "The ecosystem of this world hosts an enormous variety and abundance of parasitic life. This presents challenges to agriculture and colonization."
  pf_pm_canyon_world: "Canyon World"
  pf_pm_canyon_world_desc: "Enormous canyons are spread across this world's surface, the remnants of ancient river systems. Valuable ores present in the exposed rock provide a unique mining opportunity."
  pf_pm_tropical_archipelagos: "Tropical Archipelagos"
  pf_pm_tropical_archipelagos_desc: "The bulk of this world's land area is made up of a series of warm tropical islands clustered around the equator. The balmy climate and plentiful sunlight support lush vegetation and abundant animal life."
  pf_pm_snowball_world: "Snowball World"
  pf_pm_snowball_world_desc: "This planet is extraordinarily cold and exists at the absolute limit of the habitable zone. Ice reaches down to the equator and the poles are completely hostile to life."
  pf_pm_volcanic_soils: "Volcanic Soils"
  pf_pm_volcanic_soils_desc: "Regular volcanic activity has left this world with extraordinarily fertile soils. Plant life grows quickly and easily in the rich nutrients."
  pf_pm_chirping_plains: "Chirping Plains"
  pf_pm_chirping_plains_desc: "The wildlife of this world has a unique method of communication. Complex rhythms of chirps, clicks and growls create a passable imitation of music."
  pf_pm_bone_world: "Fossil World"
  pf_pm_bone_world_desc: "The surface of this world is covered with the scattered bones of long dead creatures. Their unusual abundance and excellent preservation provides a physical timeline of this world's evolutionary history."
  pf_pm_dry_world: "Dry World"
  pf_pm_dry_world_desc: "Water is extraordinarily rare on this world; the native life has adapted to subsist in the extremely dry conditions. The lack of water makes any effort to terraform the world into a more normal environment challenging."
  pf_pm_swamp_world: "Swamp World"
  pf_pm_swamp_world_desc: "Extensive areas of this world's surface are dominated by enormous swamp ecosystems. The terrain is treacherous and difficult to traverse without significant engineering work."
